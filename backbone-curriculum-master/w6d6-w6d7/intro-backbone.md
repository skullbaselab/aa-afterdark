# Introduction to Backbone Readings

From the [Backbone docs](http://backbonejs.org/)

> When working on a web application that involves a lot of JavaScript, one
> of the first things you learn is to stop tying your data to the DOM.
> It's all too easy to create JavaScript applications that end up as
> tangled piles of jQuery selectors and callbacks, all trying frantically
> to keep data in sync between the HTML UI, your JavaScript logic, and the
> database on your server. For rich client-side applications, a more
> structured approach is often helpful.
> 
> With Backbone, you represent your data as Models, which can be created,
> validated, destroyed, and saved to the server. Whenever a UI action
> causes an attribute of a model to change, the model triggers a "change"
> event; all the Views that display the model's state can be notified of
> the change, so that they are able to respond accordingly, re-rendering
> themselves with the new information. In a finished Backbone app, you
> don't have to write the glue code that looks into the DOM to find an
> element with a specific id, and update the HTML manually — when the
> model changes, the views simply update themselves.
