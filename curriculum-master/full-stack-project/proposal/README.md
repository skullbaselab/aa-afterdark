# Full-Stack Design Documents 

Welcome to full-stack projects! This is a hectic and exciting time, and it
represents the culmination of your education at App Academy. Now that you've
chosen your project, we want to help you build the best projects possible; so
we'll help you come up with a road map to keep yourself on track.

We are going to use Github's built-in project management to store all your
planning materials. The main document will be a wiki that outlines all the major
facets of your development process.

## Sample Design Docs

To get started, take a look at this [sample repo][sample].
This is what your design docs should look like by the time you've finished it.
We want it to be comprehensive, well-organized, and well-polished. This is not
just for our benefit; by the time you start implementing your project, you will
have already thought carefully about the functionality and scope of each
feature, allowing your future self to focus completely on writing the code for
it.

## Fleshing Out the Design Docs

The Github wiki of your project repo MUST include the following:

### Heroku Link

At the end of the first day of full-stack projects, you should have a link to
the live version of your site. It doesn't have to be pretty, but it has to be
there. Push to Heroku ASAP!

### Minimum Viable Product

- `mvp-list`

Write a one-sentence summary of the project and a list of the features that
would be absolutely necessary for the app to be marketable. Your MVP section
must follow the format outlined [here][mvp-features].

[mvp-features]: mvp-list.md

### Wireframes

### React Components with Wireframes

- `component-hierarchy`

When designing an app, we want to start with the user. To do this, we're
going to first make our wireframes. Each wireframe should be a basic
representation of the layout and information presented in a view. We
should be able to see every view of your website using your wireframes,
and how each view is reached.

In conjunction with the wireframes, diagram a tree indicating your
application's overall component structure.

Annotate your wireframes. Which React component corresponds to each
element? Keep grids in mind while drafting your layout.

Discuss how you will nest your components. If components will need
containers, indicate what state and dispatch props they will need. For
presentational components, discuss what props and state they will need.

Map out your React Routes with their respective components and paths.

See the sample for an example of this.

**NB**: Your wireframes will be viewed not only by yourself and the App
Academy staff, but potentially future employers. If you are going to use
pen and paper, it should look great. Otherwise, we recommend
[draw.io][draw.io].

### Sample State

- `sample-state`

Create a basic illustration of your state shape. Think about what information
you need to store for your app to work, and how best to organize it to minimize
duplication and maximize ease of access.

### Routes

- `routes`

Link to a page that lists your Rails API endpoints and frontend React Router
routes. Break these up between HTML and JSON endpoints. Discuss what params,
if any, will be needed for each route, and what information will be returned.

### DB Schema

- `schema`

Link to a document outlining the database schema for your app. Build up the
schema by walking through your app's wireframes. Think carefully about what data
will be needed for each view and the best way to store that data. Make note
of any database-level validations and foreign key relationships.

### Implementation Timeline

This is crucial both here and in the industry. The truth is, one never knows
how long implementing any particular phase will take. Constraints change.
Timelines are shortened without warning. An app after any phase must be able
to stand on its own. We call this building in 'slices' instead of 'layers'. To
create your timeline, add due dates to each of your milestones on Github.

## Submission

Email the repo link to your Instructional team (instructors-sf@appacademy.io or
instructors-ny@appacademy.io).  A TA will review your design docs and leave their
comments in issues on the project repo. Be prepared to respond to feedback, and
keep your wiki up to date as you make progress. Happy hunting!

## Set up your Design Documents
[Follow these instructions][fsp-instructions] to set up your Design
Docs! You will complete Phases 1 and 2 for homework. You should complete
the rest by **9am - W8D1**
