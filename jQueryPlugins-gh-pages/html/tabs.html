          Pembrokes feature pointed ears, and are somewhat smaller in
          stature than the Cardigan. Considered a practical dog, they
          are low-set, intelligent, strong and sturdy with stamina
          sufficient to work a day on the farm. The dog's head is
          fox-like and the tail short, which can be accomplished
          through breeding or docking.[2] Historically, the Pembroke
          was a breed with a natural bob tail (a very short tail), and
          today, if the Pembroke has a tail at all, it is usually
          curly. Due to the advent of tail docking in dogs, the bob
          tail was not aggressively pursued, with breeders focusing
          instead on other characteristics, and the tail artificially
          shortened if need be. Given that some countries now ban
          docking, breeders are again attempting to select dogs with
          the genes for natural bob tails. Pembrokes stand from 10
          inches (25 cm) to 12 inches (30 cm), and weigh approximately
          28 pounds (13 kg).[4]

          The Cardigan is a long, low dog with upright ears and a fox
          brush tail.[6] The old American Kennel Club standard called
          it an "Alsatian on short legs".[citation needed] The
          Cardigan's tail is long (unlike the Pembroke Welsh corgi,
          whose tail may be long,[7] naturally bobbed or
          docked[8]). Cardigans come in a variety of colors including
          any shade of red, sable, or brindle, as well as black, with
          or without tan, brindle or blue merle, with or without tan
          or brindle points.  Other unofficial colors can occur, such
          as red merle, but these colors are not considered acceptable
          per the Cardigan standard. They usually have white on the
          neck, chest, legs, muzzle, underneath, tip of the tail and
          as a blaze on the head, known as the "Irish
          pattern."[citation needed] Other markings include ticking on
          the legs and muzzle, smutty muzzles and monk's hoods,
          especially on sables (a pattern of darker tipped hairs over
          a basic red coat color.[citation needed]. An average
          Cardigan is around 10.5 to 13 inches (260 to 315 mm) tall at
          the withers and weighs from 30 to 38 lb. (13.6 to 17.2 kg)
          for the male and 25 to 34 lb. (11.3 to 15.4 kg) for the
          female.[citation needed]

          The Golden Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog bred as
          gun dogs to retrieve shot waterfowl such as ducks and upland
          game birds during hunting and shooting parties,[1] and were
          named 'retriever' because of their ability to retrieve shot
          game undamaged. Golden Retrievers have an instinctive love
          of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced
          obedience standards. They are a long-coated breed, with a
          dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in
          the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their
          bodies and repels water. Golden Retrievers are well suited
          to residency in suburban or country environments. Although
          they need substantial outdoor exercise, they should be
          housed in a fenced area because of their instinctual
          tendency to roam.[2] The dog sheds copiously, particularly
          at the change of seasons, and requires fairly regular
          grooming.
