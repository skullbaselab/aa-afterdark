# A02 Prep

Note: Assessment 2 will not test your knowledge of RSpec. It is useful to know RSpec because that will make it easier to understand why a spec is failing, but you will not be required to write any RSpec tests. The spec files may use doubles and mocks, so make sure you can understand RSpec's usage of them.

## How to prepare

* You have two practice assessments available, [Blackjack](./blackjack) and
  [Crazy Eights](./crazy-eights). Both are excellent preparation for the
assessment, so feel to use one or both.
* These practice assessments will be your best preparation for what to expect on the actual assessment. Read the specs carefully and follow along.
* For additional practice with specs, review the [Mancala HW](https://github.com/appacademy/curriculum/blob/master/ruby/homeworks/mancala).
  * You can also check out [this TTT game](https://github.com/MrPowers/tic_tac_toe/).

The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of topics that may be covered:

You should know how to:

+ Create classes
+ Create class and instance methods that allow objects to interact
+ Create a class inheritance structure
+ Raise errors when appropriate

In the practice assessments, we build a Blackjack or Crazy Eights game. You may review the basic rules on Wikipedia ([Blackjack wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack), [Crazy Eights wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crazy_Eights)). The game for the actual assessment will be announced W2D5.

## How to take the practice assessment

This assessment is somewhat more complex than the last and has specs broken out across files. 
The recommended approach is to run each spec individually. This will give you more manageable output. 
Read the instructions. The instructions will contain a suggested order in which specs should be run.
