# Pair programming

Almost 80% of project time is spent in pairs; pairs are assigned by
us each morning. Read on so that you can pair effectively!

## How to pair

In pair programming, two programmers work together at one workstation.
The **driver** types at the keyboard while the **navigator** directs
the driver. Even though the driver is at the keys, their role is the
more passive; the navigator directs the driver on what to type. The
driver executes their commands.

The foundation of pair programming is communication. Partners must
always be communicating throughout. The navigator directs the driver,
but the driver will often need clarification about what the navigator
intends for them to do. When in disagreement, the pair needs to
discuss the proper course of action.

Alternating roles is critical. Use a 15 minute timer to notify you
when you should switch:

**ABS**: Always be switching!

## Benefits of pair programming

There are a number of reasons we pair:

1. Pairs are a second pair of eyes. Since most novice mistakes are
   trivial, your pair has a greater chance of immediately identifying
   a problem that could have otherwise taken you a long time to
   discover.
2. Every student will learn different things outside of class; pairing
   is a way to bring that knowledge back into the class and share it
   with other students. This is one of the reasons we have new pairs
  for every project; we want everyone to benefit from everyone else's
  experience.
3. It is important to maintain focus throughout the class day. Working
   solo, it is easy to become distracted or zone out. Working in
   pairs, students help keep each other honest.
4. Working with other people is fun; we do a lot of coding, and it
   ought to be enjoyable.

## Pitfalls of pair programming

There are a few major pitfalls to avoid when pair programming:

If one of you is typing while the other quietly watches, you are doing
it wrong.

1. Use the timer to schedule switches. You must switch; each partner
   must have equal time in both roles.
2. Drivers must not go off and start typing on their own, they must
   follow the navigators' instructions. Avoid being a domineering
   driver.
3. Likewise, the navigator must be engaged, must ask plenty of
   questions, and must be comfortable making suggestions. Avoid being
   a passive navigator.

**If one of you is typing away and the other is passively watching,
you are both doing it wrong**.

## Text Editors

Please only use Atom, already installed. This way both members of the
pair feel equally capable of using the text editor, and can both be
fully engaged. Unfortunately, because keeping everyone engaged is so
important, we are unable to make exceptions during pairing days.

Please do not use alternate keyboard layouts or extensions that change
what the keyboard does like Vim Mode. On your personal machine you may
do as you please, but while pairing maintain the standard setup.
